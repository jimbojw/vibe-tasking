# AI-Guides (AI Conceptual)

This directory is dedicated to housing "AI-Guides (AI Conceptual)" for the Vibe Tasking project. These guides provide AI assistants with conceptual understanding, scenario explanations, or decision-making frameworks. They help the AI understand _how_ or _why_ to perform certain actions or interpret situations.

For detailed definitions of document types, including "AI-Guide (AI Conceptual)", please refer to the [Project Glossary](../reference/glossary.md).

## Directory Structure

The `ai-guides` directory is organized into two main subdirectories:

- **`core/`**: Contains AI-Guides essential for understanding, using, and maintaining the Vibe Tasking framework itself. These are fundamental to the project's methodology and core operations.
- **`contrib/`**: Contains supplementary AI-Guides that provide guidance on related topics, tools, authoring specific document types (like ADRs or Articles), or offer tutorials. These materials extend or support the use of the Vibe Tasking framework but are not part of its fundamental definition.

This structure aims to provide clarity and make it easier for both users and AI assistants to locate the specific type of AI-Guide they need.
