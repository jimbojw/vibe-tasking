# Contributed AI Guides

This directory contains AI Guides that are community-contributed or cover more specialized topics within the Vibe Tasking project. These guides supplement the [core AI Guides](../core/README.md).

Guides in this section, like all AI Guides, contain YAML frontmatter with a `usage` field describing their purpose. This metadata allows AI assistants to programmatically discover the most relevant guide for a given task.

Refer to the main [AI Guides README](../README.md) for an overview of all AI Guide categories and guidance on how AI assistants discover and utilize these documents.
