# AI Guides for Games

This directory contains AI Guides related to playing or facilitating games with an AI assistant.

Each game should reside in its own subdirectory (e.g., `sparkle/`) and include:

- The main playing guide (e.g., `sparkle-playing-guide.md`).
- Any supporting artifacts necessary for the game (e.g., rules documents, data structure definitions).
