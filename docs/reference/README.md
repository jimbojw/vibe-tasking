# Reference Documents

This directory (`docs/reference`) is intended for storing documents that provide factual, descriptive information about various aspects of the Vibe Tasking project or related technologies. Unlike the `docs/guides/` directory, which focuses on "how-to" instructions, this section is for "what things are."

Refer to the [Glossary](glossary.md) for a detailed definition of "Reference" and other documentation types.

## Purpose

Reference documents serve as a knowledge base for:

- **Technical Details:** Documenting specific APIs, data structures, configuration parameters, or architectural components.
- **Research Findings:** Consolidating outputs from research stories, such as validated information about external tools, libraries, or methodologies.
- **Glossaries & Definitions:** Defining key terms and concepts used within the project.
- **Established Facts:** Recording any stable information that team members might need to refer to.

The goal is to have a centralized place for verified information that can be easily looked up.

## Document Structure (Suggested)

While the exact structure can vary based on the content, a typical reference document might include:

- **Title:** Clear and descriptive.
- **Overview/Summary:** A brief explanation of what the document covers.
- **Detailed Information:** The core content, organized logically with headings and subheadings.
  - For APIs: Endpoints, parameters, request/response examples, authentication.
  - For Data Structures: Fields, types, relationships, examples.
  - For Concepts: Definitions, explanations, examples.
- **Sources/Links (if applicable):** Pointers to external documentation, original research, or related internal documents.
- **Last Validated (if applicable):** A date indicating when the information was last confirmed to be accurate, especially for rapidly changing external information.

Maintain clarity, accuracy, and conciseness. Use diagrams or code snippets where they aid understanding.
