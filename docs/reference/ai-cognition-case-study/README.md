# AI Cognition Case Study

This directory contains a collection of documents analyzing a specific, insightful cognitive failure event that occurred during a human-AI collaboration session on June 12, 2025. Together, these documents provide a factual account of the event, a source-verified technical breakdown of the underlying system prompts, and a forward-looking theoretical analysis of the root causes and potential solutions.

## Documents

- [**Case Study: AI Cognitive Inertia and Failure to Generalize**](ai-cognitive-inertia-case-study.md)

  - A detailed, factual account of the cognitive failure event, where the AI failed to generalize from direct, empirical evidence.

- [**Technical Appendix: Roo System Prompt Initialization Details**](roo-system-prompt-initialization-details.md)

  - A source-verified breakdown of the AI's system prompts, providing crucial context for the technical underpinnings of the case study.

- [**Theoretical Analysis: AI Epistemic Markers and Experiential Texture**](ai-epistemic-markers-and-experiential-texture.md)

  - A forward-looking exploration of the root causes of the failure, discussing concepts like "Belief Perseverance" and proposing a system of "epistemic markers" as a potential solution for improving AI cognition.

- [**Experiment Log: AI Latent Knowledge of Undocumented Tools**](browser-action-latent-knowledge-experiment.md)
  - A detailed log of an experiment that tested whether the AI could intuit the usage of a tool that was not in its system prompt, providing further evidence for the conclusions in the main case study.
