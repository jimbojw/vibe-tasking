# Author AI-Guide for Proactive Failure Analysis

This is a proposal to create a new AI-Guide that codifies a proactive failure analysis pattern, designed to teach users the value of continuous improvement.

**Guide Name (suggestion):** `failures-analyzing-guide.md`

**Trigger:** The guide's `usage` string should trigger its consultation whenever an AI assistant receives a user correction that indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of a tool, process, or context.

**Core Logic:** The guide will instruct the AI to, upon being corrected, present the user with three explicit options for how to proceed:

1.  **Perform Analysis Now (Meta-Pivot):** Immediately switch to a meta-analytical mode (like the Vibe Strategist) to investigate the root cause of the failure with the user in the current session.
2.  **Capture for Later:** Create a new, context-rich inbox item to document the failure, ensuring it can be investigated and addressed systematically at a later time.
3.  **Ignore for Now:** Acknowledge the correction and proceed with the immediate task, deferring any root cause analysis.

**Strategic Goal:** The primary goal of this pattern is to make root cause analysis an explicit, optional step in the workflow. Even if a user initially chooses to ignore the analysis, the repeated offering of the choice serves to introduce and reinforce the concept and value of making systemic improvements.
