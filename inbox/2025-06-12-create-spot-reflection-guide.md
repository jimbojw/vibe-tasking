The stories-working-guide has explicit steps for asking the AI assistant to reflect on the story just completed and offer 1-3 suggestions for potential capturing. This should be broken out into its own spot reflection guide.

A user should be able to trigger this guide by asking the AI to pause and reflect on the work just done or in progress. The AI should then consider what upstream changes could make future such work smoother, faster, better, or even less likely to need to occur. Process improvements that reduce future work are ideal.
