# Enhance `CONTEXT.md` with a Diagnostic Step

Based on the retrospective following the AI cognition case study, this is a proposal to enhance the `CONTEXT.md` onboarding document.

To make the onboarding process more robust against AI belief perseverance, the `CONTEXT.md` file could be modified to include a mandatory diagnostic action. For example, it could require the AI to execute a multi-file read and then state the number of files it successfully read.

This would force an explicit, active acknowledgment of the tool's capability before any substantive work begins, making it harder for the AI to ignore the direct evidence.

**Context:** This suggestion originated from the retrospective following the creation of the [AI Cognition Case Study](../../docs/reference/ai-cognition-case-study/README.md).
