Need a standard story to investigate and document Cursor's `*.mdc` files, typically found in `.cursor/rules`. Should yield a `docs/research` document, OR an update to the existing `cursor-ai-capabilities.md`. Relevance to Vibe Tasking should be assessed. The Vibe Strategist mode might be helpful here. Assessment should be documented in story `artifacts/` and _may_ inform other documentation including possibly guides. Research will determine applicability and further recommended changes.
