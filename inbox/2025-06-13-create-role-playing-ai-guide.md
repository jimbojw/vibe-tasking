# Create AI Guide for Role-Playing

**Suggestion from Story:** [`s076-design-ai-farkle-guide`](../../stories/s076-design-ai-farkle-guide/story.md)

The "Embodying the Role" pattern developed for the Sparkle game was very effective. We should create a new, general `contrib` AI Guide (e.g., `ai-assistants-role-playing-guide.md`) that details how an AI should adopt a persona, use direct interaction, and minimize meta-commentary for interactive tasks.

The [`sparkle-playing-guide.md`](../../ai-guides/contrib/games/sparkle/sparkle-playing-guide.md) can serve as a prime example of a guide that benefits from this pattern.
