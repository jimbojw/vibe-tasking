# Inbox for Emergent Thoughts

This `inbox/` directory is a dedicated capture point for emergent thoughts, ideas, ancillary tasks, or potential improvements that arise during work on Vibe Tasking stories. It is inspired by the "Inbox" concept from David Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) methodology.

## Purpose

- To provide a low-friction, reliable place to quickly record items that have your attention without disrupting your current task flow.
- To ensure these "open loops" are captured externally for later processing and organization.

## Usage

- Each captured item should be a separate Markdown (`.md`) file within this directory.
- Filename convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md` (e.g., `2025-06-08-create-adr-for-guide-discovery.md`).
- The content of each file is simply the raw captured thought. No specific internal structure is prescribed.

For detailed guidance on capturing items, please refer to the (forthcoming) `inbox-capturing-guide.md`.
For details on how these items are processed, refer to the (forthcoming) `inbox-processing-guide.md`.

**IMPORTANT:** This `README.md` file **MUST NOT** contain an index or list of the inbox items themselves. Such lists easily become outdated. The items are individual files within this directory.
