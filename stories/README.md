# Vibe Tasking - Stories

This directory (`stories`) is where user stories and their associated artifacts for the Vibe Tasking project itself are documented. It also serves as a living example of how the Vibe Tasking framework can be used.

Detailed guidance on how Vibe Tasking stories are structured, planned, and worked on can be found in the following dedicated AI Guides:
