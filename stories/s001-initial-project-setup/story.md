# Story: s001 - Initial Project Setup

## Description

As a project initiator, I want to establish the foundational Vibe Tasking framework structure and core documentation files so that the project has a solid basis for tracking future work and can serve as a self-documenting example of the framework itself.

This involved creating the main project README, license, contribution guidelines, the story documentation guide, and defining the directory-per-story structure.

## Artifacts (Links)

- Project README: [../../../README.md](../../../README.md)
- License: [../../../LICENSE](../../../LICENSE)
- Contribution Guidelines: [../../../CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Story Documentation Guide: [../README.md](../README.md)
- This Story's Directory: [./](./)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Root `README.md` created with project overview and pointers.
- [x] `LICENSE` file (Apache 2.0) added to the project root.
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` file added to the project root.
- [x] Story documentation guide created at `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
- [x] Directory-per-story structure (`story.md`, `journal.md`, `artifacts/`) defined and implemented.
- [x] This story (s001) created/updated to document the initial project setup.
