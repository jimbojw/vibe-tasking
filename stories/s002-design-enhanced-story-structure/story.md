# Story: s002 - Design Enhanced Story Structure

## Description

As a Vibe Tasking user and designer, I want to collaborate with an AI assistant (Cline) to identify additional requirements for the Vibe Tasking framework and design an enhanced story structure that satisfies these new requirements.

This story focuses on the requirements gathering and design phase. The primary output will be a detailed specification for an enhanced story structure. The decision to implement this new structure (either within this story or in a subsequent one like s003) will also be an outcome of this story.

## Artifacts (Links)

- Current Story Documentation Guide: [../README.md](../README.md)
- Initial Project Setup Story: [../s001-initial-project-setup/story.md](../s001-initial-project-setup/story.md)
- Design Document for Enhanced Structure (to be created): [./artifacts/enhanced-story-structure-design.md](./artifacts/enhanced-story-structure-design.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Additional functional and non-functional requirements for Vibe Tasking's story structure are identified and documented. (Achieved through collaborative discussion and recorded in `journal.md`)
- [x] A collaborative design session (or series of interactions) with the AI assistant (Cline) is completed to explore solutions. (Achieved, documented in `journal.md` and `artifacts/enhanced-story-structure-design.md`)
- [x] A detailed design specification for the enhanced story structure is produced and stored as `artifacts/enhanced-story-structure-design.md`. (Completed)
- [x] A decision is made and recorded on whether the implementation of the new design will be part of this story (s002) or deferred to a new story (e.g., s003).
  - **Decision:** The implementation of the enhanced story structure (including updates to the Story Documentation Guide and any necessary migration of existing stories) will be handled in a new, subsequent story (e.g., s003). Story s002 is now considered complete as its focus was on requirements and design.
