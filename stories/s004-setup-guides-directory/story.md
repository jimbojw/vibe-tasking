# Story: s004 - Set Up docs/guides Directory and Initial CONTEXT Document Guide

## Description

As a project maintainer, I want to establish a `docs/guides` directory and create an initial guide on designing and using CONTEXT documents (like `CONTEXT.md`), so that instructional content for project-specific tasks can be clearly organized, easily accessible, and consistently formatted.

## Artifacts

- `docs/ai-guides/` (New directory)
- `[Guides Directory README](../../ai-guides/README.md)`
- `[Guide for CONTEXT Documents](../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/context-documents-writing-guide.md)`
- `[Docs Directory README](../../README.md)` (Created or Updated)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `docs/ai-guides/` directory exists.
- [ ] A guide for writing and using CONTEXT documents (e.g., `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/context-documents-writing-guide.md`) exists within `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/`.
- [ ] A `docs/ai-guides/README.md` file exists that describes what kinds of things go into `docs/ai-guides` as well as suggested formatting.
- [ ] A `docs/README.md` file exists (or is created) with a list of subdirectories within `docs/` (including `ai-guides/`) and their purposes.
