# Story: s005 - Investigate Cline Command Output Capture Issue

## Description

**User Story:** As a Vibe Tasking user leveraging Cline, I want to understand why command output is not consistently captured so that I can reliably verify command execution and diagnose issues.

**Details:** Cline executes commands successfully but sometimes fails to return the output to the chat UI. The typical error message observed is: "Error executing command: The command ran successfully, but we couldn't capture its output. Please proceed accordingly." This story is a research task to investigate the potential causes of this behavior.

## Artifacts (Links)

- [Handling Command Output Issues Guide](../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/handling-command-output-issues.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research potential causes for the command output capture failure in Cline.
- [ ] Document findings, including any identified root causes or contributing factors.
- [ ] If a root cause is found, outline potential solutions or workarounds.
- [ ] If no definitive root cause is found, document the investigation steps and any partial findings.
- [ ] Provide links to relevant external resources (e.g., bug reports, documentation) in the story's artifacts section or journal.
- [ ] Update this story's status and journal with progress.
