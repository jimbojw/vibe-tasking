# Story: s006 - Update Project Motivation in README

## Description

As a project maintainer, I want to expand on the project's motivation in the main `README.md` so that users and contributors better understand the "Why Vibe Tasking?" aspect, particularly concerning the optimization of coder/AI assistant interaction.

**Details:**

The current `README.md` provides a good overview of the project objectives. This story aims to enhance the "Overview" or add a new "Motivation" section to elaborate on the reasons behind creating Vibe Tasking. Key points to cover include:

- The current landscape of AI assistant UX and model capabilities.
- How Vibe Tasking aims to optimize the interaction between developers and AI assistants within these constraints.
- The benefits of a repository-integrated approach for AI collaboration.

This story includes an interview component: the AI assistant (Cline) will ask the user (project owner) questions to gather more specific context and refine the messaging for the README.

## Artifacts

- [Interview notes captured in journal.md](journal.md)
- Main project [README.md](../../../README.md) (updated)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] An interview with the project owner has been conducted to gather detailed insights into the project's motivation.
- [x] The main `README.md` has been updated to include a clear and compelling explanation of the project's motivation.
- [x] The updated motivation section effectively communicates the "Why Vibe Tasking?" aspect.
- [x] The changes are reviewed and approved.
