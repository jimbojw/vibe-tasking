# Story: s007 - Create docs/reference Directory and Guide

## Description

As a project maintainer, I want to set up a new `docs/reference/` directory so that we have a dedicated place to store documents that describe "what things are" (e.g., API details, data structures, validated information from research).

**Details:**

The `docs/guides/` directory is for "how-to" instructions. The new `docs/reference/` directory will complement this by providing a space for factual, descriptive information that might be the output of research stories or a place to consolidate validated technical details.

This story involves:

1.  Creating the `docs/reference/` directory.
2.  Creating a `README.md` file within `docs/reference/` that:
    - Explains the purpose of the `docs/reference/` directory.
    - Provides a rudimentary overview or template for what reference documents should contain (similar to how `docs/guides/README.md` outlines guide structure).

## Artifacts

- `docs/reference/README.md` (to be created)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The `docs/reference/` directory has been created.
- [x] A `README.md` file exists in `docs/reference/`.
- [x] The `docs/reference/README.md` clearly explains the purpose of the directory.
- [x] The `docs/reference/README.md` provides basic guidelines or a suggested structure for reference documents.
- [x] The new structure is reviewed and approved.
