# Journal: s010 - Standardize User Satisfaction and Validation in Story Completion

## 2025-05-16T21:22:27-0400

- Story `s010` created to address the need for standardizing user satisfaction checks and validation steps within the Vibe Tasking story completion process.
- **Problem Identified:** AI assistants might prematurely mark stories as "Done" without explicit user confirmation or offering to perform validation tasks (e.g., running tests, demonstrating features).
- **Proposed Solution:**
  1. Update `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md` to strengthen guidance on writing acceptance criteria, making it a best practice to include:
     - Explicit user confirmation steps.
     - Steps for validation, testing, or demonstration of work, where applicable.
  2. AI assistants (specifically Cline in this context) to adopt a refined operational procedure of always seeking user satisfaction and offering validation before closing out a story.
- **Rationale:** This will improve the quality of story completion, ensure user expectations are met, and foster a more iterative and collaborative interaction with AI assistants.
- Next steps:
  - User to review the proposed `story.md` for `s010` and this initial journal entry. (User approved during planning)
  - If approved, switch to ACT MODE. (Currently in ACT MODE)
  - Create `s010` directory and these files. (This and previous step)
  - Update `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
  - Complete `s010` by updating its `story.md` (status to "Done", check ACs) and `journal.md`.

- Updated `story.md` for this story (s010) to "Done" and marked all acceptance criteria as complete.
- AI assistant (Cline) acknowledges the updated best practice for future story execution.
- Story s010 is now complete.
