# Story: s010 - Standardize User Satisfaction and Validation in Story Completion

## Description

As a project maintainer using Vibe Tasking, I want the story documentation guide (`docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`) to explicitly state that acceptance criteria **SHOULD** include user confirmation and relevant validation steps (like testing or demonstrating functionality).

This enhancement aims to ensure that AI assistants, when executing stories, are guided to prompt for these crucial steps before considering a story complete. This will lead to higher quality outcomes, better alignment with user expectations, and more robust AI/user collaboration within the Vibe Tasking framework.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md` file is updated within or immediately following its "Acceptance Criteria" section to include a note emphasizing that effective acceptance criteria **SHOULD** include steps for:
  - User confirmation of satisfaction with the implemented changes.
  - Applicable validation activities such as running tests, executing scripts, or demonstrating functionality.
- [x] The AI assistant (Cline) acknowledges this updated best practice for its future story execution. (Meta-acknowledgment for this story's purpose).
- [x] This story (`s010`) is documented with its `story.md` and `journal.md`, and then marked as "Done".
