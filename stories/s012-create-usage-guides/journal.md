# Journal: s012 - Create Vibe Tasking Usage Guide(s)

## 2025-05-16T21:42:39-0400

- Story `s012` created to develop comprehensive usage guidance for the Vibe Tasking framework.
- **Need Identified:** Beyond installation, users require guidance on both tactical (day-to-day) and strategic (longer-term, effective collaboration) use of Vibe Tasking.
- **Scope of Usage Guide(s):**
  - **Tactical:** `CONTEXT.md` usage, journaling best practices, artifact management, writing effective `story.md` content (descriptions, ACs), iterative refinement.
  - **Strategic:** Structuring stories for different work phases, managing larger features/epics, principles of AI collaboration (context, prompting, Curiosity/Empathy/Humility), context recovery.
- **Deliverable (for future execution of this story):** One or more new guide documents in `docs/guides/`.
- This story file (`story.md`) and this initial journal entry created. The actual implementation of creating the usage guides will occur when this story (`s012`) is prioritized and executed.

- Story `s012` is being closed with resolution "Obsolete".
- **Reasoning:**
  - A review (see journal entry in `s028-add-resolution-field/journal.md` dated 2025-05-19T07:56:14-04:00) determined that most topics proposed in `s012` are now substantially covered by other existing guides or the core `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
  - The Vibe Tasking framework was enhanced via story `s028-add-resolution-field` to include a `resolution` field and a `"Closed"` status, allowing for more accurate classification of stories like this one.
- The original intent of `s012` (to provide comprehensive usage guidance) has been largely met through other documentation efforts and framework evolution.
