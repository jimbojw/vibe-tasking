# Journal: s014 - Refactor Main README for Clarity, Conciseness, and Quick Start

## 2025-05-16T21:55:06-0400

- Story `s014` created to address the need for a more concise and user-focused main `README.md`.
- **Key Objectives for README Refactor:**
  1.  **Clarity:** Immediately convey "What is Vibe Tasking?" with an emphasis on AI collaboration.
  2.  **Quick Start:** Provide a clear and prominent path for "How to install/set up Vibe Tasking," linking to the installation guide.
  3.  **Conciseness:** Reduce overall length for better new-user readability.
  4.  **Motivation Re-evaluation:** Analyze the current "Motivation" section. Explore options to condense it, move detailed discussions to other documents (e.g., usage guides from `s012`, or a new reference document), or adjust its prominence based on the effectiveness of other guides in conveying benefits.
- **Process (for future execution of this story):** The AI assistant executing this story will propose changes, discuss with the user, and then implement the approved refactoring.
- This `story.md` and initial `journal.md` for `s014` have been created. The actual refactoring work will occur when this story is prioritized and executed.
