# Story: s014 - Refactor Main README for Clarity, Conciseness, and Quick Start

## Description

As a project maintainer, I want to refactor the main `README.md` to be more concise and to more effectively serve new users by:

1.  Immediately and clearly explaining **what Vibe Tasking is**.
2.  Providing a prominent and straightforward path on **how to install/set up** Vibe Tasking in their own projects, primarily by linking to the `docs/guides/beginners-guide.md`.

This refactor also involves re-evaluating the existing "Motivation" section. The goal is to explore options such as:

- Tightening the current "Motivation" content within the `README.md`.
- Moving some detailed motivational aspects or discussions of "Vibe Coding" challenges to other, more specialized documents (e.g., new usage guides to be created in `s012`, or a dedicated reference document).
- Determining if the prominence of the "Motivation" section can be reduced if new usage guides effectively convey the benefits through practical application.

The AI assistant executing this story will be expected to analyze the current `README.md`, propose a revised structure and content, discuss these proposals with the user, and then implement the approved changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The `README.md` is analyzed, and a revised structure/content plan is proposed to the user.
- [x] The "Overview" section (or its equivalent) in the refactored `README.md` clearly and concisely explains what Vibe Tasking is, with a primary focus on its role in AI-assisted development.
- [x] The refactored `README.md` prominently features a section or link detailing how to install/set up Vibe Tasking, directing users to `docs/guides/beginners-guide.md`.
- [x] The "Motivation" section is reviewed, and a decision is made and implemented regarding its content (e.g., condensed, partially moved, or significantly restructured).
- [x] If content is moved from the `README.md` to other documents, those target documents (or placeholders/stories for them) are identified.
- [x] The overall length and flow of the `README.md` are improved for better new-user experience.
- [x] User confirms satisfaction with the refactored `README.md`.
- [x] This story (`s014`) is documented with its `story.md` and `journal.md`, and then marked as "Done".
