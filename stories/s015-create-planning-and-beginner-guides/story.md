# Story: s015 - Create Comprehensive Planning and Beginner Guides

## Description

This story covers the creation of two essential guides for the Vibe Tasking project: a "Planning Guide" and a "Beginners Guide."

The **Planning Guide** details the Vibe Tasking methodology for different types of work (Planning, Research, Design, Implementation). Its primary audience is AI assistants, providing them with instructions on how to effectively assist users in creating Vibe Coding story files. This includes guidance on suggesting metadata, defining acceptance criteria for each work type, and asking a limited number of context-enhancing questions.

The **Beginners Guide** serves as an introduction for new users to the Vibe Tasking system. It explains the basic concepts, shows the directory structure with examples, and links to other relevant documentation.

## Artifacts

- [Planning Guide](../../guides/planning-guide.md)
- [Beginners Guide (now Onboarding Guide)](../../onboarding/README.md)

- [x] A new guide document, "Beginners Guide" (e.g., `docs/guides/beginners-guide.md`), is created.
- [x] The Beginners Guide provides a basic introduction to using the Vibe Tasking system for new users.
