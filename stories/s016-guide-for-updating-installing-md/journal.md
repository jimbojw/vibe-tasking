# Journal: s016 - Create Guide for Updating INSTALLING.md

## 2025-05-19T03:35:00-0400

- Story `s016` created.
- **Purpose:** To create a guide for AI assistants detailing how to update the `INSTALLING.md` file, specifically its embedded "CONTENT FOR docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md" section, to keep it synchronized with the canonical `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
- This guide will reside in `docs/guides/`.
- The root `CONTEXT.MD` will also be updated to reference this new guide for AI maintenance tasks.
- Process-related acceptance criteria (updating status, initial journal entry, ongoing journaling) were added to the `story.md` to ensure these steps are followed during execution.

- Created the new guide `docs/guides/updating-installing-md-guide.md`.
- Attempted to update `docs/guides/README.md` to link the new guide, but user indicated a preference against maintaining such lists in READMEs, so this step was skipped.
- Encountered errors attempting to update `CONTEXT.MD` with a "Maintenance Notes for AI Assistants" section. This step could not be completed due to tool errors initially.
- Upon user reloading VSCode window, a subsequent attempt to update `CONTEXT.MD` was successful.
- All Acceptance Criteria in `story.md` have been marked as complete (or noted as skipped per user preference).
- Story `s016` status has been set to "Done".
- All planned file creations and modifications for this story are now complete.
