- Story `s018` created.
- **Purpose:** To update `docs/guides/planning-guide.md` to explicitly instruct AI assistants to halt after creating new story files (`story.md`, `journal.md`, directory) and to await user direction before starting work on the newly defined story. This is to prevent premature execution.
