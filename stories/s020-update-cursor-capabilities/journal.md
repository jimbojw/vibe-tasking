- Completed 'Update Cursor AI Capabilities Document' checkpoint.
  - Cursor AI (myself) was provided with `docs/reference/cursor-ai-capabilities.md`.
  - `docs/reference/cursor-ai-capabilities.md` was updated based on self-introspection of my capabilities.
  - User confirmed satisfaction with the updated document.
  - **Key Finding:** User and AI collaboratively determined that Cursor AI's Agent/General Chat modes are functionally equivalent to Cline AI's Act/Plan modes. This equivalence was documented in `docs/reference/cursor-ai-capabilities.md`.
  - **Documentation Harmonization:** Subsequently, `docs/reference/cline-capabilities.md` was also updated to reflect this equivalence from Cline's perspective. The layout of the note in `docs/reference/cursor-ai-capabilities.md` was then adjusted to harmonize with the `cline-capabilities.md` document.
  - All ACs for this checkpoint, including the documentation updates, marked as complete in story.md.
- Proceeding to 'Final Review and Closure' checkpoint.
