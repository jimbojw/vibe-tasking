# Story: s020 - Update Cursor AI Capabilities Document via Self-Introspection

## Description

As a project maintainer, I want the `docs/reference/cursor-ai-capabilities.md` document to be updated by the Cursor AI assistant itself, so that its capabilities are accurately documented through first-person introspection rather than third-person research.

The core task involves running Cursor AI, providing it with the existing `docs/reference/cursor-ai-capabilities.md` and other relevant files from `docs/reference/`, and instructing it to augment and refine its own capability documentation.
