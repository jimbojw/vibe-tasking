- **Completed Checkpoint: Update Windsurf Capabilities Document**
  - Windsurf AI (Cascade) was provided with `windsurf-capabilities.md` and context from `ai-assistant-capabilities.md`, `cursor-ai-capabilities.md`, and `cline-capabilities.md`.
  - Cascade performed self-introspection and updated `windsurf-capabilities.md` to reflect its current toolset and operational paradigm (AI Flow).
  - Key additions to the document included:
    - Detailed breakdown of capabilities based on available tools, categorized logically.
    - A new section "Operational Nature: Beyond Fixed Modes" to clarify how Cascade's agentic AI Flow paradigm relates to the modal operations of other assistants (Cursor, Cline).
    - An analogy comparing Cascade's fluid operation to an "automatic transmission" versus the "manual transmission" of explicitly modal AIs, to aid user understanding.
  - User reviewed the changes and confirmed satisfaction with the clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the updated `windsurf-capabilities.md`.
  - All ACs for this checkpoint were marked as complete.

**Checkpoint:** Final Review and Closure

**Summary:**
Story `s021-update-windsurf-capabilities` has been completed.
- User confirmed satisfactory completion of all previous checkpoints ("Initial Story Setup," "Update Windsurf Capabilities Document") and their ACs.
- Story status updated to "Done" and resolution set to "Completed".
- `docs/adrs/adr-015-enhancing-ac-update-compliance.md` and `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md` were updated to consistently use "Windsurf/Cascade" nomenclature and to clarify Cascade's interaction patterns for checkpoint reviews, aligning with the project's documentation standards and the spirit of this story.
- All ACs for the "Final Review and Closure" checkpoint are now complete.

**Decisions:**
- Ensured consistent naming ("Windsurf/Cascade") across relevant ADR and guide documents.
- Clarified how Windsurf/Cascade's natural dialogue and `suggested_responses` fit into the Vibe Tasking checkpoint review protocol.

This concludes story `s021`.
