- Story `s022` created during a planning session.
- Goal: To design and document a single, comprehensive validation guide for the `INSTALLING.md` AI playbook, covering both "New Installation" and "Upgrade Existing Installation" paths. This guide will serve as a standard for testing the playbook's execution by various AI assistants.

- Status changed to "Blocked".
- Resolution updated to "Blocked pending outcome of s043".
- Rationale: Pending the outcome of s043 (research zip installer path). This story validates the current INSTALLING.md, which may be replaced by a new process resulting from s043.
