- Story `s023` created during a planning session.
- Goal: To validate the `INSTALLING.md` playbook using GitHub Copilot, focusing on its handling of limited capabilities, as per the forthcoming validation guide from story `s022`.
- An artifact documenting Copilot's behavior during the validation will be produced.
- Insights from this validation may also inform potential tweaks to `INSTALLING.md` for better performance with similar AI assistants.

- Status changed to "Blocked".
- Resolution updated to "Blocked pending outcome of s043".
- Rationale: Pending the outcome of s043 (research zip installer path). This story validates the current INSTALLING.md, which may be replaced by a new process resulting from s043.
