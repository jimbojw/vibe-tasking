# Journal: s025 - Validate INSTALLING.md (New Install & Upgrade) with Cline

## 2025-05-19T07:41:42-04:00

- Story `s025` created during a planning session.
- Goal: To validate both new installation and upgrade paths of the `INSTALLING.md` playbook using Cline, following the guide from `s022`.
- The upgrade path test will specifically use a project with a pre-existing robust `CONTEXT.md`.
- An artifact documenting validation observations and behavioral findings will be produced.
- Insights from this validation may also inform potential tweaks to `INSTALLING.md`.

- Status changed to "Blocked".
- Resolution updated to "Blocked pending outcome of s043".
- Rationale: Pending the outcome of s043 (research zip installer path). This story validates the current INSTALLING.md, which may be replaced by a new process resulting from s043.
