## 2025-05-19T07:42:48-04:00

- Story `s027` created during a planning session.
- Goal: To validate both new installation and upgrade paths of the `INSTALLING.md` playbook using Windsurf (Codeium Cascade), following the guide from `s022`.
- An artifact documenting validation observations and behavioral findings will be produced.
- Insights from this validation may also inform potential tweaks to `INSTALLING.md`.

- Status changed to "Blocked".
- Resolution updated to "Blocked pending outcome of s043".
- Rationale: Pending the outcome of s043 (research zip installer path). This story validates the current INSTALLING.md, which may be replaced by a new process resulting from s043.
