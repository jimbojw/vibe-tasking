# Journal: s034 - Create Vibe Tasking Workflow Guide

## 2025-05-19T20:56:51Z

- Story `s034` created to develop a new guide: `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md`.
- **Type:** Implementation Story (for documentation).
- **Goal:** Document three key Vibe Tasking workflows (Full Feature Lifecycle, Iterative Development, Architectural Challenges) using ASCII diagrams and detailed explanations, as specified in `story.md`.
- Workflows and format discussed with the user.

## 2025-05-19T20:59:12Z

- Work on story `s034` has commenced.
- Status updated to "In Progress" in `story.md`.
- Next step is to create the `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` file.

## 2025-05-19T20:59:46Z

- The `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` file has been created with the three specified workflows, ASCII diagrams, and explanations.
- The documented workflows are:
  1. Workflow 1: The Full Feature Lifecycle (Sequential Focus)
  2. Workflow 2: Iterative Development with Feedback Loops (referred to as Workflow 3 in planning)
  3. Workflow 3: Addressing Architectural Challenges with Iterative PoCs (referred to as Workflow 4 (Revised) in planning)
- Ready for user confirmation of the guide's content.

## 2025-05-19T21:26:39Z

- Updated Workflow 1 in `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` to the new tree-like diagram style with bracket boxes and Title Case labels, incorporating all discussed refinements (indentation, spacing, concise diagram notes, "story creation" clarification).
- The textual explanation for Workflow 1 was also updated to reflect the consolidated "Story Phase" concept.
- Awaiting user switch to Plan Mode to discuss updates for Workflow 2 and Workflow 3.

## 2025-05-19T21:37:38Z

- Replaced the original Workflow 1 in `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` with the new "Workflow 1: The Vibe Tasking Story Lifecycle".
- This new Workflow 1 details the iterative lifecycle of a single story and features the un-indented diagram style.
- The original Workflow 1 (Full Feature Lifecycle) is now effectively Workflow 2 in the document, and the original Workflow 3 (Iterative PoCs) is Workflow 3. Their content remains unchanged for now.
- Ready for user to switch to Plan Mode to discuss updates for the subsequent workflows.

## 2025-05-19T21:43:35Z

- Inserted the "Full Feature Lifecycle" as the new Workflow 2 in `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md`.
- This Workflow 2 uses the indented, tree-like diagram style with bracket boxes and Title Case labels, as finalized in Plan Mode.
- The subsequent workflows in the document have been renumbered to Workflow 3 (formerly Workflow 2 - Iterative Development with Feedback Loops (Legacy)) and Workflow 4 (formerly Workflow 3 - Addressing Architectural Challenges with Iterative PoCs).
- Awaiting user switch to Plan Mode to discuss styling for Workflow 3 and Workflow 4.

## 2025-05-19T21:49:22Z

- Removed the legacy "Iterative Development with Feedback Loops" workflow (which was Workflow 3) from `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md`.
- Renumbered the "Addressing Architectural Challenges with Iterative PoCs" workflow to be the new Workflow 3.
- Removed parenthetical notes about previous numbering from the purpose statement of the new Workflow 3.
- The guide now contains three workflows:
  1. The Vibe Tasking Story Lifecycle
  2. The Full Feature Lifecycle
  3. Addressing Architectural Challenges with Iterative PoCs
- The next step is to apply the consistent styling to the new Workflow 3.

## 2025-05-19T21:52:19Z

- Updated "Workflow 3: Addressing Architectural Challenges with Iterative PoCs" in `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` to the consistent indented, bracket-box, Title Case style.
- Consolidated its steps into "Story Phases" and revised its explanation accordingly, ensuring it references "Workflow 1: The Vibe Tasking Story Lifecycle" for phase execution details.
- All three workflows in the guide now have a consistent visual and explanatory style.
- The `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` file is now complete as per the defined acceptance criteria for content and styling.

## 2025-05-20T11:16:40Z

- Applied the final "taller" diagram style with selective un-indentation and vertical bar continuity to "Workflow 3: Addressing Architectural Challenges with Iterative PoCs" in `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md`.
- This ensures all three workflows in the guide share a consistent and refined visual presentation.
- The guide is now finalized.

## 2025-05-20T11:20:23Z

- User confirmed that all acceptance criteria for story `s034` have been met.
- The `docs/guides/workflow-guide.md` is complete and accurately reflects all discussed Vibe Tasking workflows with consistent styling.
- Story `s034` status updated to "Done" and resolution to "Implemented" in `story.md`.
- This story is now complete.
