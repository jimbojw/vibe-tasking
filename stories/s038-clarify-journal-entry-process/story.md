# Story: s038 - Clarify Journal Entry Process for Appending Entries

## Description

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the Vibe Tasking documentation to explicitly state that new journal entries should be appended to existing journal content, so that AI assistants consistently preserve the chronological log when starting work on stories or making updates.

**Details:** This story addresses an ambiguity where AI assistants might overwrite existing journal content (e.g., an entry made during story creation) when adding an "initial journal entry" for commencing work. The fix involves clarifying wording in `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`, `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md`, and ensuring `INSTALLING.md` is synchronized. It also includes a backfill step to update existing active stories with the clarified AC wording.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Initial Story Setup**

  - [x] **Process:** Story status is updated to "In Progress" in this story.md file's frontmatter upon starting work.
  - [x] **Process:** A new journal entry is appended to `journal.md` for this story, noting work has commenced.
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms the overall Acceptance Criteria list for this story is accurate and complete before proceeding with substantive work Checkpoints.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Update Core Documentation Wording**

  - [x] The standard Acceptance Criterion for journal entries in `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md` (within the "Initial Story Setup" checkpoint example) is updated to explicitly mention appending (e.g., "A new journal entry is appended to `journal.md`...").
  - [x] The `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md` section related to making the first journal entry when commencing work (currently "Initial Journal Entry") is updated. The title and content should clarify that the entry is appended (or the file created if non-existent).
  - [x] `docs/guides/updating-installing-md-guide.md` is consulted.
  - [x] If `INSTALLING.md` contains an embedded version of `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`'s ACs, `INSTALLING.md` is updated to reflect the new wording for the journal entry AC, following the procedure in `docs/guides/updating-installing-md-guide.md`.
  - [x] User confirms the wording changes in `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`, `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md`, and (if applicable) `INSTALLING.md` are clear and correct.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Backfill Existing Stories' AC Wording**

  - [x] A list of all stories currently in "To Do", "In Progress", or "Blocked" status is identified.
    - _Note for AI Assistant: This list can be generated by searching `story.md` files within the `docs/stories/s*` directories for these statuses. For example, one might use a command like `grep -l -E '^status: "(To Do|In Progress|Blocked)"' docs/stories/s*/story.md`. If direct command execution or output capture is problematic, refer to the [Handling Command Output Issues Guide](../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/handling-command-output-issues.md) for strategies such as redirecting command output to a temporary file (e.g., `.tmp_ai_output/s038_backfill_stories.txt`) and then reading that file's content._
  - [x] For each story identified in the list (excluding s038 itself):
    - [x] The `story.md` file is reviewed.
    - [x] The Acceptance Criterion related to adding a journal entry upon commencing work (typically the second AC in the "Initial Story Setup" checkpoint) is updated to match the new "append" wording from `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
  - [x] User confirms all identified active stories have had their relevant AC updated.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Enhance Checkpoint Structure with Journaling AC**

  - [x] **Process:** Update `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`'s "Standard Process Checkpoints & ACs (Recommended Structure)" section. For each example Checkpoint (Initial Story Setup, First Substantive Phase, Second Substantive Phase, Final Review and Closure), ensure it concludes with the following process ACs (or their equivalent, adapted for context): 1. `- [ ] **Process:** All ACs within this '[Checkpoint Name]' Checkpoint are reviewed with the user and marked as complete (`- [x]`).` 2. `- [ ] **Process:** Journal updated to reflect completion of this '[Checkpoint Name]' Checkpoint and any significant decisions made within it.` 3. `- [ ] **Process:** User approval is obtained to proceed to the next Checkpoint.` (Omit #3 for the "Final Review and Closure" example). Remove any now-redundant broader process ACs from the "Final Review and Closure" example.
  - [x] **Process:** Consult `docs/guides/updating-installing-md-guide.md`.
  - [x] **Process:** Update `INSTALLING.md` to reflect the new standardized end-of-checkpoint ACs from `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms changes to `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md` and `INSTALLING.md`.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Review and Update `working-on-stories-guide.md` for Journaling Emphasis**

  - [x] **Process:** Review `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md`, specifically the "Checkpoint Review Protocol" and "Maintain the Journal" sections.
  - [x] **Process:** If necessary, update the "Checkpoint Review Protocol" in `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md` to explicitly mention that updating the journal is a part of completing the protocol.
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms any changes to `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md` are appropriate.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Backfill Stories with New Journaling AC in Checkpoints**

  - [x] **Process:** Identify all stories currently in "To Do", "In Progress", or "Blocked" status.
    - _Note for AI Assistant: This list can be generated by searching `story.md` files within the `docs/stories/s*` directories for these statuses. For example, one might use a command like `grep -l -E '^status: "(To Do|In Progress|Blocked)"' docs/stories/s*/story.md`. If direct command execution or output capture is problematic, refer to the [Handling Command Output Issues Guide](../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/handling-command-output-issues.md) for strategies such as redirecting command output to a temporary file (e.g., `.tmp_ai_output/s038_new_backfill_stories.txt`) and then reading that file's content._
  - [x] **Process:** For each identified story (excluding s038 itself):
    - [x] Review its `story.md`.
    - [x] For every existing Checkpoint in its Acceptance Criteria, append the three standard process ACs (as defined in the updated `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`, adapted as needed, e.g., omitting "approval to proceed" for the story's final checkpoint). Remove any older, now-redundant general process ACs from their "Final Review and Closure" sections if they are superseded by the new standardized set.
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms all identified stories have had the new journaling AC added to their checkpoints.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Final Review and Closure**
  - [x] **Process:** The journal.md for this story is kept up-to-date with entries detailing progress, decisions, and Checkpoint completions _as they are made_.
  - [x] **Process:** Upon completing each Checkpoint, the AI assistant has performed the **Checkpoint Review Protocol** (as defined in `docs/guides/working-on-stories-guide.md`) with the user, ensuring all relevant ACs are confirmed and marked, before asking to proceed.
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms all Checkpoints and their ACs are satisfactorily completed.
  - [x] **Process:** Story status is updated to "Done" (or other terminal status) and `resolution` field is set appropriately.
