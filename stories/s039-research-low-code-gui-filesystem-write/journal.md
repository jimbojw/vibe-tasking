# Journal: s039-research-low-code-gui-filesystem-write

- Story s039 planned with Cline.
- Objective: Research low-code GUI options for creating a "hello world" application that can write data to the filesystem within the project repository (specifically to `artifacts/output.txt` in this story).
- Key considerations: VS Code compatibility, low-code, potential use of Python/tkinter or VS Code Webview APIs.
- Rationale: Explore non-text interaction modalities for AI-assisted workflows, where GUI actions can generate file-based output consumable by an AI.
