# AI-Guides (AI Conceptual)

This directory is dedicated to housing "AI-Guides (AI Conceptual)" for the Vibe Tasking project. These guides provide AI assistants with conceptual understanding, scenario explanations, or decision-making frameworks. Unlike [AI-Playbooks](../ai-playbooks/README.md) (which are executable scripts), these AI-Guides help the AI understand _how_ or _why_ to perform certain actions or interpret situations.

## Structure and Purpose

AI-Guides in this directory serve two primary purposes:

1.  **VT-Core Project Maintenance AI-Guides:** Located directly within this `ai-guides/` directory, these are conceptual AI-Guides for AI assistants on maintaining or updating aspects of the Vibe Tasking Core project itself (e.g., `updating-installing-md-guide.md`, `updating-onboarding-guide.md`).
2.  **General Vibe Tasking Framework Usage AI-Guides:** Located in the `vibe-tasking/` subdirectory, these are conceptual AI-Guides for AI assistants on how to assist users with the general Vibe Tasking framework in _their own_ projects (e.g., `planning-guide.md`, `working-on-stories-guide.md`).

The aim is to provide AI assistants with the necessary background and contextual knowledge to perform their tasks more effectively and assist users with greater accuracy.
