# Vibe Tasking Framework Usage AI-Guides (AI Conceptual)

This directory contains AI-focused conceptual AI-Guides related to the general use of the Vibe Tasking framework. These AI-Guides are intended to help AI assistants understand _how_ or _why_ to perform certain actions, interpret situations, or assist users effectively when working with Vibe Tasking in _any_ project.

Unlike [AI-Playbooks](../../ai-playbooks/README.md) (which are executable scripts), these AI-Guides provide broader contextual understanding and decision-making frameworks for the AI.

AI-Guides in this directory cover topics such as planning stories, working on stories, and writing effective context documents.

Refer to the [Glossary](../../../reference/glossary.md) for a detailed definition of "AI-Guide (AI Conceptual)" and its sub-categories.
