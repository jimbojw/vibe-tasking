# Vibe Tasking Starter Package

Welcome to the Vibe Tasking Starter Package! This archive (`vibe-tasking.zip`) contains the essential files and core documentation to help you quickly set up and use the Vibe Tasking framework in your own software development project.

## What is Vibe Tasking?

Vibe Tasking is a lightweight, documentation-centric framework for optimizing user/AI assistant interaction during software development. It uses simple Markdown files to manage development tasks, requirements, and context, enhancing AI accuracy and streamlining workflows.

For a full overview, please see the included `docs/stories/README.md` (once installed in your project) or visit the main Vibe Tasking project repository.

## Contents of this Package

This archive is structured to mirror the recommended Vibe Tasking setup within your project. When unzipped, you will find a `vibe-tasking/` directory containing:

- **`CONTEXT.md`**: A template file. You (with AI assistance) will customize this to provide project-specific context to your AI assistants. This is crucial for effective AI collaboration.
- **`INSTALLING.md`**: An AI-Playbook. Provide this file to your AI assistant to guide it through the process of installing these Vibe Tasking files into your project.
- **`README.md`** (this file): Information about this starter package.
- **`LICENSE`**: The Apache License 2.0 for Vibe Tasking.
- **`docs/`**: Contains core Vibe Tasking documentation:
  - `docs/stories/README.md`: The canonical guide explaining Vibe Tasking story structure, metadata, and conventions. **Essential reading.**
  - `docs/ai-guides/README.md`: An overview of the AI Guides.
  - `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/`: Contains key conceptual guides for AI assistants to help you use Vibe Tasking effectively (e.g., `planning-guide.md`, `working-on-stories-guide.md`).

## Getting Started: Installation

1.  **Unzip this Archive:** Extract the contents of `vibe-tasking.zip` to a temporary location on your computer. You should see a `vibe-tasking/` directory.
2.  **Use Your AI Assistant:**
    - Open your AI assistant (e.g., Cline, Cursor, Copilot Chat).
    - Provide the content of the `INSTALLING.md` file (located inside the unzipped `vibe-tasking/` directory) to your AI assistant.
    - The AI assistant will use this playbook to guide you through copying and setting up these files in your target project directory.
    - You will be asked to specify the root directory of your existing project where Vibe Tasking should be installed.

## Next Steps After Installation

Once your AI assistant has completed the installation using `INSTALLING.md`:

1.  **Customize `CONTEXT.md`:** Open the `CONTEXT.md` file in your project root and fill in the details specific to your project. This is a critical step for effective AI collaboration.
2.  **Review Core Documentation:**
    - Familiarize yourself with `docs/stories/README.md` in your project to understand how Vibe Tasking stories are structured and managed.
    - Browse the AI guides in `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/` to learn about planning stories, working on them, and other best practices.

Thank you for choosing Vibe Tasking! We hope it enhances your development workflow.
