# Journal: s046 - Create AI-Guide for Writing AI-Playbooks

## 2025-05-22T09:52:18Z (America/New_York)

- Story `s046` created.
- **Title:** Create AI-Guide for Writing AI-Playbooks
- **Objective:** To research, design, and document a standard methodology for creating effective AI-Playbooks. This will result in a new guide: `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/writing-ai-playbooks-guide.md`.
- The guide will establish best practices and a recommended structure for AI-Playbooks, drawing inspiration from the Vibe Tasking story model (Checkpoints, Tasks, Process steps, user approval points).
- This story was identified as beneficial during discussions for story `s043` (Research Alternative Zip-Based Installation Path), as the `INSTALLING.md` for the zip package is itself an AI-Playbook.
- Initial `story.md` drafted with proposed checkpoints and acceptance criteria.

- Updated `story.md` for s046 based on user feedback.
- Added reference to "The Checklist Manifesto" by Atul Gawande in the "Details" section.
- Amended Acceptance Criteria for drafting the "hello-world" AI-Playbook and the `writing-ai-playbooks-guide.md` to explicitly include consideration of principles from "The Checklist Manifesto" (e.g., designing clear, concise, actionable tasks to prevent expert oversight and ensure effective AI execution).
