# Journal: s050 - Refactor Vibe Tasking Onboarding Material

## 2025-05-22T18:29:33Z

- Story `s050` created to refactor the existing Vibe Tasking onboarding documentation.
- **Type:** Documentation Refactor.
- **Goal:** Align the Vibe Tasking onboarding with the new "Vibe Coding" tutorial series (from `s049`), creating a clear and logical learning path for users.
- **Key Activities:** Audit existing content, restructure the series, update links, and ensure focus on framework-specific knowledge.
- **Dependency:** Relies on the completion or well-defined structure of `s049`.
- Initial metadata and scope discussed with the user.

- **Action:** Story status updated to "Closed" and resolution to "Obsolete" in `story.md`.
- **Reason:**
  - The story's primary objective was to refactor content within a `docs/articles/onboarding/` directory.
  - Investigation confirmed this directory does not exist.
  - The current article structure in `docs/articles/`, particularly the reading path defined in its `README.md`, appears to fulfill the onboarding objectives intended for `s050`.
  - This existing onboarding path seems to incorporate the outputs of the dependency story `s049-create-vibe-coding-tutorial-series` (which is "Done" and "Implemented").
  - Therefore, `s050` is considered superseded by the current documentation structure.
