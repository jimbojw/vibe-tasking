# Journal: s051 - Design Story Dependency Tracking in Frontmatter

## 2025-05-22T18:35:33Z

- Story `s051` created to research and design a method for tracking dependencies between Vibe Tasking stories using YAML frontmatter.
- **Type:** Research & Design.
- **Goal:** Evaluate options for formalizing story dependencies to improve queryability and project visibility. This includes considering how such a mechanism would interact with the current `status: "Blocked"` and `resolution: "Pending completion of sNNN"` pattern. Outcomes may include an ADR and updates to core story documentation.
- **Motivation:** Observed informal dependency notes in stories like `s050` highlight the need for a more structured approach.
- Initial metadata and scope discussed with the user.
