# Journal: s052 - Codify and Apply AI Guide Writing Standards

## 2025-05-22T20:37:02Z

- Story planned to first create a new guide, `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/writing-ai-guides.md`, to codify standards for AI guide authorship (imperative voice, audience declaration, templates).
- Subsequently, all existing AI guides in `docs/ai-guides/` (and subdirectories) will be reviewed and aligned with this new standard.
- An ADR may also be created to document the decision for this standardization.
- This initiative aims to ensure consistency and clarity for AI assistants utilizing these guides.
