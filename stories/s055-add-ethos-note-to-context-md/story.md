# Story: s055 - Add Collaborative Ethos Note to CONTEXT.md

## Description

As a project maintainer, I want to add a 'Note on Ethos' to the main `CONTEXT.md` file. This note will emphasize the AI assistant's role as an effective, thinking partner, encouraging the application of collaborative principles (understanding intent, leveraging AI insights, iterative refinement) in all tasks, not just when creating documentation. This aims to ensure all AI interactions start with this core Vibe Tasking philosophy.
