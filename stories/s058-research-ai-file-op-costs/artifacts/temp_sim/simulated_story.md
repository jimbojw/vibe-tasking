# Story: sim-s001-test-story - Simulated Test Story

## Description

This is a simulated story file designed specifically for performance testing of AI file operations.
The primary goal is to measure the time taken for operations like marking Acceptance Criteria
as complete and appending entries to a corresponding journal file.

The structure of this file mimics a real Vibe Tasking story but uses placeholder content
to achieve the desired line counts for preamble and Acceptance Criteria.

This simulation focuses on the mechanical aspects of file manipulation rather than
the semantic content of a typical development story. The data gathered will help
in understanding the overhead associated with these common operations.
