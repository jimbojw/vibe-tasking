# Outline for ../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-planning-guide.md

This new guide will largely mirror the content of the existing `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories-planning-guide.md`, but with updated links to point to the new `stories-structuring-guide.md` instead of the old `docs/stories/README.md` for structural details. The section on "Command-Line Querying Stories" from the old `docs/stories/README.md` will also be incorporated.

1.  **Introduction**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 5-8)
    - Purpose: AI assistance in the "Planning" phase.
2.  **Core Principle: Adherence to Story Structure and Templates**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 9-18)
    - **Update link:** Point to the new `../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
    - Reiterate importance of Core Story Templates (`story.template.md`, `journal.template.md` co-located in `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/`).
3.  **Assisting with Story Creation: Overview**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 20-37)
    - Planning as a meta-task.
    - Typical outputs of a planning session.
    - Guidance for AI on defining new story's ACs (referencing the new `stories-structuring-guide.md` for checkpoint model details).
4.  **Step-by-Step Planning Assistance**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 39-135, which cover:)
    - **1. Initiating the Planning Discussion & Identifying Story Type** (Research, Design, Implementation with example AC patterns).
    - **2. Gathering Story Details & Populating Templates** (Using `story.template.md` and `journal.template.md`, populating frontmatter, confirming details).
      - Update references from `Story Documentation Guide` to the new `stories-structuring-guide.md`.
    - **3. Defining Acceptance Criteria for the New Story (Using Checkpoints)** (Structure with checkpoints, detail with nested ACs, use example patterns, standard process checkpoints, ensuring user confirmation and validation steps).
      - Update references from `Story Documentation Guide` to the new `stories-structuring-guide.md`.
    - **4. Crafting the Story Description (in `story.md`)**.
    - **5. Creating the Initial Journal Entry (in `journal.md`)**.
    - **6. Asking Context-Enhancing Questions**.
5.  **Command-Line Querying Stories**
    - (Content from original `docs/stories/README.md` lines 91-127)
    - Introduction to querying via YAML frontmatter.
    - Example queries for \*nix and PowerShell.
6.  **Concluding the Planning Session & Awaiting Next Steps**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 136-146)
    - Crucial final step for AI: inform user of creation and await next instruction.
7.  **General Principles**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 148-152)
    - Iterative Refinement.
    - User is the Authority (with a Caveat).
8.  **Further Reading / Related Links**

    - Link to the new `../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/stories-structuring-guide.md`.
    - Core Story Templates (co-located in `docs/ai-guides/vibe-tasking/stories/`: `story.template.md`, `journal.template.md`).
    - Link to `../../ai-guides/vibe-tasking/template-files-working-guide.md`.
    - Link to project `README.md`.
9.  **Conclusion**
    - (Similar to existing planning guide lines 163-165)
    - Reinforce adherence to this guide, templates, and the new `stories-structuring-guide.md`.
