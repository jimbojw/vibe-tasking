# Journal: s067-codify-story-review-retrospective - Codify AI-Guided Story Review and Retrospective Process

## 2025-06-06T14:24:23Z

- Story `s067-codify-story-review-retrospective` created to define and integrate an AI-guided review and retrospective process into the standard Vibe Tasking story lifecycle. This aims to improve continuous learning and AI-Guide maintenance by making retrospectives a standard, AI-assisted part of story completion. The need was identified from the `docs/articles/agile-ai-development.md` article, where retrospectives are currently a user-assigned task.
- Story created using `story.template.md`.
