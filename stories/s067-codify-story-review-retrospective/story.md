# Story: s067-codify-story-review-retrospective - Codify AI-Guided Story Review and Retrospective Process

## Description

As a Vibe Tasking user, I want the process of reviewing a completed story and performing a retrospective to be codified as standard AI-guided acceptance criteria, so that opportunities for process improvement (like new/updated AI-Guides) are consistently identified and acted upon.

## Artifacts

- [Agile Reimagined: Applying Timeless Principles to AI-Centric Development](../../../docs/articles/agile-ai-development.md)
- (Link to the updated `story.template.md` once this story is implemented)
- (Link to a new AI Guide for "Conducting Story Retrospectives" if created as part of this story)

## Acceptance Criteria

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each Acceptance Criterion below, you **MUST** mark it by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (or `- [X]`).

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Initial Story Setup**

  - [x] **Process:** Story status is updated to "In Progress" in this `story.md` file's frontmatter upon starting work.
  - [x] **Process:** A new journal entry is _appended_ to `journal.md` for this story, noting work has commenced.
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms the overall Acceptance Criteria list for this story is accurate and complete before proceeding with substantive work Checkpoints.
  - [x] **Process:** All ACs within this 'Initial Story Setup' Checkpoint are reviewed with the user and marked as complete (`- [x]`).
  - [x] **Process:** Journal updated to reflect completion of this 'Initial Story Setup' Checkpoint.
  - [x] **Process:** User approval is obtained to proceed to the next Checkpoint.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Design and Document Retrospective Process**

  - [x] The standard Vibe Tasking story retrospective process is designed, focusing on AI-guided interaction.
  - [x] Key questions and prompts for the AI to guide the user through the retrospective are defined (e.g., "What went well?", "What could be improved?", "Were there any ambiguities in the story or AI-Guides?", "Are there any new AI-Guides or updates to existing ones that would have helped?").
  - [x] The process for identifying and potentially initiating the creation/update of AI-Guides based on retrospective feedback is outlined.
  - [x] The AI's reflection process is designed, specifying aspects for the AI to analyze post-story completion (e.g., tool usage efficacy, frequency/nature of user corrections, clarity of original story ACs, effectiveness of consulted AI-Guides, overall conversational flow).
  - [x] The mechanism for the AI to generate 1-3 specific, actionable suggestions for process improvement (for Vibe Tasking core or the host project) based on its reflection is defined.
  - [x] This designed process is documented by incorporating it as a new section within the existing `ai-guides/core/stories/stories-working-guide.md`.
  - [x] **Process:** All ACs within this 'Design and Document Retrospective Process' Checkpoint are reviewed with the user and marked as complete (`- [x]`).
  - [x] **Process:** Journal updated to reflect completion of this 'Design and Document Retrospective Process' Checkpoint and any significant decisions made within it.
  - [x] **Process:** User approval is obtained to proceed to the next Checkpoint.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Update Story Template with Retrospective ACs**

  - [x] The `ai-guides/core/stories/story.template.md` is updated to include a new standard "Checkpoint: Story Review and Retrospective" within its "Final Review and Closure" section or as a new final checkpoint.
  - [x] This new checkpoint in the template includes ACs for the AI to:
    - [x] Guide the user through a review of the completed story's outcomes against its ACs.
    - [x] Lead the user through the defined retrospective questions/prompts.
    - [x] Perform an internal reflection on the completed story, analyzing its execution (e.g., tool usage, user feedback patterns, AC clarity, AI-Guide effectiveness).
    - [x] Present 1-3 specific, actionable suggestions for process improvement (for Vibe Tasking core or the host project) to the user, based on the reflection.
    - [x] Discuss the AI's suggestions with the user and record any decisions or next steps (e.g., creating new stories for suggestions, updating guides).
    - [x] Assist in identifying potential new AI-Guides or updates to existing ones.
    - [x] Offer to help draft or update these identified AI-Guides.
    - [x] Confirm with the user that the retrospective is complete.
  - [x] The updated `story.template.md` is reviewed and approved by the user.
  - [x] **Process:** All ACs within this 'Update Story Template with Retrospective ACs' Checkpoint are reviewed with the user and marked as complete (`- [x]`).
  - [x] **Process:** Journal updated to reflect completion of this 'Update Story Template with Retrospective ACs' Checkpoint.
  - [x] **Process:** User approval is obtained to proceed to the next Checkpoint.

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Final Review and Closure**
  - [x] **Process:** User confirms all Checkpoints and their ACs are satisfactorily completed.
  - [x] **Process:** Story status is updated to "Done" (or other terminal status like "Closed") and `resolution` field is set appropriately in this `story.md`'s frontmatter.
  - [x] **Process:** All ACs within this 'Final Review and Closure' Checkpoint are reviewed with the user and marked as complete (`- [x]`).
  - [x] **Process:** Journal updated to reflect completion of this 'Final Review and Closure' Checkpoint and the story's overall completion.
