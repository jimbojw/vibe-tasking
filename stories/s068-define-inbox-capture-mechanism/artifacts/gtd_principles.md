# Key GTD Inbox Principles for Vibe Tasking Emergent Thought Capture

This document outlines key principles from David Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) methodology, specifically focusing on the 'Inbox' concept and its relevance to capturing emergent thoughts, ideas, or ancillary tasks within the Vibe Tasking project.

## Core GTD Inbox Principles

1.  **Capture Everything:**

    - **GTD Principle:** The mind is for having ideas, not holding them. Any thought, task, idea, or commitment that has your attention should be captured externally.
    - **Vibe Tasking Relevance:** During work on a story, users or AI assistants might have insights, identify related tasks, or think of improvements not directly in scope. These "open loops" need a reliable capture point to prevent them from being forgotten or disrupting current focus.

2.  **Minimize Inboxes:**

    - **GTD Principle:** While you can have multiple inboxes, keep the number as small as possible and ensure they are all regularly processed to empty.
    - **Vibe Tasking Relevance:** A single, clearly defined digital "inbox" mechanism within the Vibe Tasking project structure is preferable for simplicity and ensuring all captured items are channeled to one reviewable location.

3.  **Empty Inboxes Regularly (Processing):**

    - **GTD Principle:** Captured items in an inbox are not meant to stay there. They must be regularly processed: clarified, organized, and have next actions decided upon.
    - **Vibe Tasking Relevance:** Items captured in the Vibe Tasking inbox are temporary placeholders. A separate process (to be defined, likely in story `s069`) will be needed to review these items and decide their fate (e.g., convert to a new story, archive, discard). The capture mechanism itself should be distinct from this processing step.

4.  **Quick Capture:**
    - **GTD Principle:** The act of capturing should be fast and easy to minimize friction and encourage immediate offloading of thoughts.
    - **Vibe Tasking Relevance:** The Vibe Tasking inbox mechanism must be extremely low-friction for both users and AI assistants to encourage its use without significantly interrupting the flow of the primary task.

## GTD Horizontal Workflow Context

The "Inbox" is the entry point to GTD's five-stage horizontal workflow:

1.  **Capture (Collect):** Gather items into the inbox.
    - _Vibe Tasking Focus for s068: This is the primary concern of the "inbox capture mechanism."_
2.  **Process (Clarify):** Understand what each item is and if it's actionable.
    - _Vibe Tasking Relevance: This will be handled by a subsequent process (e.g., story `s069`), not by the capture mechanism itself._
3.  **Organize:** Put processed items where they belong (project lists, next action lists, calendar, reference, etc.).
    - _Vibe Tasking Relevance: For Vibe Tasking, "organizing" an actionable inbox item will likely mean converting it into a new story (standard or lightweight) or adding it to an existing one._
4.  **Review (Reflect):** Regularly look over your system to ensure it's current and complete.
    - _Vibe Tasking Relevance: Users will need to periodically review their Vibe Tasking inbox and project lists._
5.  **Do (Engage):** Execute on chosen actions.
    - _Vibe Tasking Relevance: This corresponds to working on Vibe Tasking stories._

For story `s068`, the focus is squarely on the **Capture** phase – establishing a reliable, low-friction method to get emergent thoughts into a trusted collection point within the Vibe Tasking project.
