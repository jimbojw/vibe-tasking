# Journal: s072-adr-ai-guide-discovery-mechanism - Create ADR for AI Guide Discovery Mechanism

## 2025-06-09T18:52:05Z

- Story collaboratively planned to address inbox item `inbox/2025-06-08-create-adr-for-find-grep-ai-guide-discovery-mechanism.md`.
- The goal is to create an ADR documenting the current AI Guide discovery mechanism (`find`/`grep` based).
- Story created using `story.template.md` and subsequently updated to use `lightweight-story.template.md`.

- Work commenced on story s072.
- Status updated to "In Progress" in story.md.
- Consulted stories-working-guide.md and stories-structuring-guide.md.

- AI Retrospective Suggestions:
  1.  Suggestion: The `adrs-writing-guide.md` could benefit from a reminder to link to other relevant ADRs within "Cons" or "Rationale" sections if an alternative/decision directly relates to or conflicts with a principle from another ADR (e.g., `adr-001-code-free-framework.md` in this story).
  2.  Suggestion: The process for assessing story "easiness" (reading story, then related guides/templates, then listing files for numbering) was effective. This could be a micro-pattern for a future, specific AI-Guide if "story assessment" requests are common.
  3.  Suggestion: For complex ADRs, explicitly suggesting user review section-by-section, rather than the whole document at once, might streamline feedback.
