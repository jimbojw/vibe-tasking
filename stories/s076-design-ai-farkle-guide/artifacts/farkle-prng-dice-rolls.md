## Mechanism for PRNG-Based Dice Rolls

To ensure dice rolls are genuinely random and not fabricated by the AI, a mechanism involving the execution of a shell command that leverages a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is proposed. A Python one-liner is suitable for this due to Python's common availability and its `random` module.

**Proposed Command:**

The AI assistant should execute a command similar to the following, substituting `N` with the number of dice to be rolled:

```bash
python -c "import random; num_dice = N; print(*(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_dice)))"
```

**Breakdown:**

- `python -c "..."`: This invokes the Python interpreter to execute the code provided in the string.
- `import random;`: Imports the necessary `random` module from the Python standard library.
- `num_dice = N;`: The AI will replace `N` with the integer representing the number of dice required for the current roll (e.g., `6` for a full roll, or fewer if some dice are held).
- `print(*(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_dice)))`:
  - `random.randint(1, 6)`: This function call generates a single random integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive), simulating a standard die face.
  - `( ... for _ in range(num_dice))`: This is a generator expression that executes `random.randint(1, 6)` for `num_dice` times, yielding a sequence of random dice values.
  - `*`: The asterisk unpacks the sequence of dice values generated by the expression into individual arguments for the `print` function.
  - `print(...)`: This function will output the dice values to standard output. By default, multiple arguments to `print` are separated by a single space.

**Example Execution (Rolling 6 Dice):**

If the AI needs to roll 6 dice, it would construct and execute:

```bash
python -c "import random; num_dice = 6; print(*(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_dice)))"
```

A possible output captured by the AI from stdout would be:
`1 5 2 6 3 5`

**Example Execution (Rolling 2 Dice):**

```bash
python -c "import random; num_dice = 2; print(*(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_dice)))"
```

A possible output:
`4 1`

**AI Responsibility:**

The AI will be responsible for:

1.  Determining the correct number of dice to roll (`N`) based on the current game state.
2.  Constructing the command string with the correct value for `N`.
3.  Executing the command using a tool like `execute_command`.
4.  Capturing the standard output from the command.
5.  Parsing the space-separated string of numbers from the output into a list of integers representing the dice roll outcome.

This method ensures that dice rolls are sourced from a PRNG and are not influenced by the AI's internal state beyond determining how many dice to roll.
