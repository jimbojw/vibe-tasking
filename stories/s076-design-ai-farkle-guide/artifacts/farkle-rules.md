## Standard Farkle Rules

**Objective:** Be the first player to reach a target score (commonly 10,000 points).

**Equipment:** 6 standard six-sided dice.

**Gameplay:**

1.  **Turns:** Players take turns rolling the six dice.
2.  **Initial Roll & Scoring:**
    - After the initial roll (and any subsequent rolls in the turn), the player must set aside at least one scoring die or a valid scoring combination.
    - If no scoring dice are rolled on the first roll of a turn, or any subsequent roll where new dice are thrown, it's a "Farkle." The player scores 0 for that turn, and their turn ends.
3.  **Continuing the Turn:**
    - If the player successfully sets aside scoring dice, they accumulate points for those dice for the current turn.
    - The player can then choose to:
      - **Bank Points:** End their turn. The points accumulated in this turn are added to their overall score.
      - **Roll Again:** Roll the remaining dice that were not set aside for scoring.
    - **Hot Dice:** If all six dice have been set aside as scoring dice, the player has "Hot Dice." They can choose to roll all six dice again and continue their turn, building on their current turn's score. If they Farkle after rolling Hot Dice, they lose all points from that turn.
4.  **Farkle:** If, at any point when rolling dice (initial roll or subsequent rolls), the player rolls no scoring combinations with the dice they threw, they "Farkle."
    - They lose all points accumulated _for that specific turn_.
    - Their turn ends immediately.
5.  **Getting on the Board (Optional Rule):**
    - Some variations require a player to achieve a minimum score in a single turn (e.g., 500 points) before they can bank any points for the first time. This is known as "getting on the board." Once on the board, they can bank any amount of points on subsequent turns.
6.  **Winning:**
    - The first player to reach or exceed the target score (e.g., 10,000 points) tentatively wins.
    - Typically, all other players get one final turn to try to surpass the high score. The player with the highest score after these final turns wins.

**Common Scoring Values (These can vary by house rules):**

- **Single Dice:**

  - A single `1`: 100 points
  - A single `5`: 50 points
  - (Other dice `2`, `3`, `4`, `6` only score as part of combinations)

- **Three of a Kind (Triplets):**

  - Three `1`s: 1000 points (sometimes 300, or a higher bonus if rolled simultaneously)
  - Three `2`s: 200 points
  - Three `3`s: 300 points
  - Three `4`s: 400 points
  - Three `5`s: 500 points
  - Three `6`s: 600 points

- **Other Combinations (Examples, can vary significantly):**
  - **Four of a Kind:** Often 1000 points, or double the three-of-a-kind value. (e.g., Four `2`s = 400 points or 1000 points).
  - **Five of a Kind:** Often 2000 points, or double the four-of-a-kind value. (e.g., Five `2`s = 800 points or 2000 points).
  - **Six of a Kind:** Often 3000 points, or a higher bonus, sometimes an automatic win. (e.g., Six `2`s = 1200 points or 3000 points).
  - **Straight (1-2-3-4-5-6 rolled with six dice):** Typically 1500 or 2500 points.
  - **Three Pairs (e.g., 2-2, 4-4, 6-6 rolled with six dice):** Typically 750 or 1500 points.
  - **Two Triplets (e.g., 2-2-2, 5-5-5 rolled with six dice):** Typically 2500 points.
  - **Full House (Three of a kind and a pair):** Not always a standard scoring combination in Farkle, but sometimes included.

**Important Note on Combinations:** Dice can only be part of one scoring combination at a time. For example, if a player rolls `1-1-1-5-2-3`, they can score the three `1`s (1000 points) and the single `5` (50 points) for a total of 1050. The `1`s cannot also be counted as individual `1`s if used in the triplet.
