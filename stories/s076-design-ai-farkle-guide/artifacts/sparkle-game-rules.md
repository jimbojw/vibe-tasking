## Scoring Rules

The goal is to be the first player to score 10,000 points.

### Basic Scoring

- Single Spark (💡): 100 points
- Single Rocket (🚀): 50 points
- Other single dice are not worth any points on their own.

### Three-of-a-Kind (Triples)

- 💡💡💡 (Three Sparks): 300 points
- 📘📘📘 (Three Plans): 300 points
- ✅✅✅ (Three Criteria): 300 points
- ⏰⏰⏰ (Three Deadlines): 400 points
- 🚀🚀🚀 (Three Rockets): 500 points
- 🔮🔮🔮 (Three Vision Reviews): 600 points

### Special Combinations

- 💡💡💡💡 (Four Sparks): 1000 points (in the same roll)
- Six-of-a-Kind (any face): 5000 points (in the same roll)

### House Rules

- **Getting on the Board:** You must score at least 500 points in a single turn to "get on the board." Until you do, you cannot bank any points.
- **Hot Dice:** If all six of your dice score points in a single roll, you have "Hot Dice!" Your turn continues and you must roll all six dice again to build on your current score.
- **Feature Freeze:** If you roll the dice and get no scoring combinations, that's a "Feature Freeze! 🥶" You lose any points you accumulated during that turn and your turn ends.

## Example Turns

### Turn 1: Failing to Launch

You are not yet on the board (you have 0 total points).
You roll: ⏰ ⏰ ⏰ 📘 🔮 📘
You score: You have three Deadlines (⏰⏰⏰), which are worth 400 points. The other dice don't score.
Your decision: Your 400 points are less than the 500-point minimum to get on the board. You cannot bank these points. You must set aside your three scoring dice (⏰⏰⏰) and re-roll the remaining three dice (📘🔮📘).
You re-roll: 📘 ✅ 🔮
You score: This roll has no scoring dice. This is a Feature Freeze! 🥶
Result: You lose the 400 points you set aside. Your turn is over, and your score remains 0.

### Turn 2: A Successful Launch

You are on the board with 1200 points.
You roll: 💡 💡 🚀 🚀 🔮 📘
You score: You have two Sparks (💡💡) for 200 points (100 each) and two Rockets (🚀🚀) for 100 points (50 each).
Calculation: 100 + 100 + 50 + 50 = 300 points.
Your decision: 300 points is a good start. You decide to press your luck. You set aside the four scoring dice (💡💡🚀🚀) and re-roll the remaining two dice (🔮📘).
You re-roll: 💡 🔮
You score: The Spark (💡) is worth another 100 points. Your running total for the turn is now 300 + 100 = 400.
Your decision: Things are getting risky with only one die left to roll. You decide to bank your points.
Result: You add 400 points to your score. Your new total is 1600. Your turn ends.

### Turn 3: Going Supernova with Six-of-a-Kind

You are on the board with 2500 points.
You roll: 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
You score: Six-of-a-Kind! This is an automatic 5000 points.
Your decision: Because all six dice scored, you have "Hot Dice!" You must roll all six dice again. The 5000 points are temporarily safe.
You re-roll: 💡 🚀 📘 ✅ 🔮 📘
You score: You have one Spark (💡) for 100 points and one Rocket (🚀) for 50 points, for a total of 150 points on this roll.
Calculation: 5000 (from the first roll) + 150 (from this roll) = 5150 total for the turn.
Your decision: You have four dice remaining. You could roll again, but banking over 5000 points in one turn is incredible. You choose to stop and bank your points.
Result: You add 5150 points to your score. Your new total is 7650. Your turn ends.
