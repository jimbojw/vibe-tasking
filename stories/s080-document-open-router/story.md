# Story: s080-document-open-router - Create Reference Document for Open Router

## Description

As a Vibe Tasking maintainer, I want to create a reference document explaining Open Router, so that users and AI assistants can understand its role, particularly concerning AI model availability and capabilities relevant to Vibe Tasking.

The document should cover:

- What Open Router is.
- Its relevance to Vibe Tasking (e.g., how it relates to AI model selection and tool availability like `browser_action`).
- A link to the Open Router website.

## Artifacts

- `docs/reference/open-router.md` (To be created)
- (Potentially) Link to Open Router website: https://openrouter.ai/

## Acceptance Criteria

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each Acceptance Criterion below, you **MUST** mark it by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (or `- [X]`).

- [ ] **Checkpoint: Combined - Story Execution and Closure**

  - [ ] **Process:** The '`stories-working-guide.md`' AI Guide has been consulted for current best practices.
  - [ ] **Process:** Story status is updated to "In Progress" in this `story.md` file's frontmatter upon starting work.
  - [ ] **Process:** A new journal entry is _appended_ to `journal.md` for this story, noting work has commenced.
  - [ ] **Process:** User confirms the 'Core Task' AC below is accurate, complete, and suitable for a lightweight story.
  - [ ] **Core Task:** A new reference document `docs/reference/open-router.md` is created that:
    - Explains what Open Router is.
    - Details its relevance to Vibe Tasking, particularly regarding AI model access and how it can affect tool/capability availability.
    - Includes a link to the official Open Router website.
    - Is added to the `docs/reference/README.md` index.
  - [ ] **Process:** User reviews and approves the completion of the 'Core Task' and any related sub-tasks.
  - [ ] **Process (Retrospective):** AI performs an internal reflection on the completed story, analyzing its execution.
  - [ ] **Process (Retrospective):** AI appends its 1-3 specific, actionable suggestions for process improvement to the `journal.md`.
  - [ ] **Process (Retrospective):** AI briefly lists its journaled suggestions to the user and asks if it's okay to proceed with story closure. (User may optionally provide feedback or create inbox items for suggestions at this point).
  - [ ] **Process:** Story status is updated to "Done" (or other terminal status like "Closed") and `resolution` field is set appropriately in this `story.md`'s frontmatter.
  - [ ] **Process:** All ACs within this 'Combined - Story Execution and Closure' Checkpoint are reviewed with the user and marked as complete (`- [x]`).
  - [ ] **Process:** Journal updated to reflect completion of this Checkpoint and the story's overall completion.
