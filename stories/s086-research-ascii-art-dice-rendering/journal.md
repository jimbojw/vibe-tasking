- Story `s086-research-ascii-art-dice-rendering` created.
- Purpose: To research, experiment with, and codify a method for rendering ASCII-art dice using box-drawing characters, suitable for monospace display. This will result in a new AI Guide: `ai-guides/contrib/rendering/ascii-art-dice-rendering-guide.md`.
- The research will be iterative, involving the AI presenting examples in chat and the user providing visual feedback.
- The work will be based on initial draft guidance provided by the user, which includes specifications for dice styles (rollable/held), dimensions, border characters, and pip layouts.
- This guide is intended to support applications like the Farkle game (story `s076`).
- Story created using `ai-guides/core/stories/story.template.md`.
