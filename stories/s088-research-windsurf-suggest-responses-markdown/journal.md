# Journal: s088-research-windsurf-suggest-responses-markdown - Research Windsurf suggest_responses Markdown Handling

## 2025-06-11T15:21:52Z

- Story collaboratively planned with AI assistance.
- Created using `lightweight-story.template.md`.
- Initial goal is to research and document Markdown handling in Windsurf's `suggest_responses` feature, following up on observations from a deleted inbox item regarding Roo Code's `ask_followup_question` tool.

- Updated the `Description` in `story.md` to clarify the relationship with story `s085-research-chat-markdown-rendering`.
- Added notes on the documentation strategy:
  - If `s085` finishes after `s088`, `s088`'s findings should be incorporated into `s085`'s comprehensive `ai-chat-markdown-rendering-capabilities.md` document.
  - If `s088` finishes first, documenting its findings in `windsurf-capabilities.md` is sufficient, with `s085` to reference/incorporate later.
