- **Collaborators:** User, Roo (AI Assistant)
- **Template Used:** [`lightweight-story.template.md`](ai-guides/core/stories/lightweight-story.template.md)
- **Notes:**
  - This story was created to address the inbox item `inbox/2025-06-10-enhance-contextmd-training-visibility-in-install-guide.md` by enhancing `ai-guides/core/context/context-documents-authoring-guide.md`.
  - The goal is to instruct AI assistants, after helping create a project's `CONTEXT.md`, to offer to update the project's main `README.md` with instructions on how to use `@CONTEXT.md` for initializing chat sessions. This aims to improve visibility and adoption of the `CONTEXT.md` convention.

- Story renumbered from `s087-enhance-context-authoring-guide-readme-update` to `s089-enhance-context-authoring-guide-readme-update` due to a duplicate story ID. The story [`stories/s087-research-random-numbers-guide/`](stories/s087-research-random-numbers-guide/) was determined to be created earlier and retained the `s087` identifier.
- Directory renamed from `stories/s087-enhance-context-authoring-guide-readme-update` to `stories/s089-enhance-context-authoring-guide-readme-update`.
- The `id` field in `story.md` frontmatter and the H1 title were updated to reflect the new story ID `s089-enhance-context-authoring-guide-readme-update`.
