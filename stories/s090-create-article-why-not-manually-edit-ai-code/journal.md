- Core Task AC completed: Article `docs/articles/why-not-manually-edit-ai-generated-code.md` created and refined.
- Relevant process ACs marked as complete in `story.md`.
- AI Retrospective Suggestions:
  1. Suggestion: For inbox items that clearly define a story's scope and type (e.g., "lightweight story"), consider adding a note to `stories-planning-guide.md` about potentially streamlining or confirming the bypass of initial grooming/AC validation ACs if the user agrees the context is sufficiently clear.
  2. Suggestion: The iterative refinement of the article, including a dedicated brevity pass ("Strunk & White" style), was effective. This could be a recommended step in `articles-writing-guide.md` for prose-heavy tasks.
